I am the first to admit I am an addict to the EA Sports series FIFA. I have been since my idol David Beckham Appeared on the front cover of 'FIFA 98 Road To World Cup' (let's not dwell on that world cup year as we know what happened to Mr Beckham). FIFA is currently on FIFA 17 and the drastic change over the years has been incredible. From graphics, Advertising to actual FIFA Interactive players for top class world clubs like Man City and West Ham. These players will play against other players from around the world representing respective clubs.

EA Sports released the first title in this series in 1993 with FIFA International Soccer. This game went on to be #11 in the Top 50 Mega Drive Titles. EA didn’t know how this would take off. The graphics at the time were cutting edge and with football being such a huge game it was quickly one of the bestselling games. In the years since FIFA has evolved from just a handful of international teams with fictional names, to officially licenced club and country sides from across the globe with thousands of real players featured in both name and likeness.
