Electronic Arts' UFC franchise "feels" like a biennial series, CEO Andrew Wilson told Fortune, but EA has yet to make a final decision about how often the company will release the mixed martial arts games.
EA purchased the UFC publishing rights from THQ in June 2012. The company's first mixed martial arts fighting game, EA Sports UFC, was announced at E3 2013 and is in development at EA Canada for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
Several EA Sports titles are annualized, including the long-running FIFA soccer, Madden football and NHL hockey franchises. According to Wilson, EA hasn't yet determined whether UFC games will follow that pattern.
"Do I think that UFC would be an every year game?" Wilson asked. "I don't know. It feels like it's in that every-other-year mix, but in all honesty we haven't made that decision yet. That really comes down to how long it's going to take to make a great game and when do we think the audience is ready."
Wilson also explained that a combination of player desire and developer capability determines how often EA releases franchise games.
"There are products that we will do every year, and there are products that we'll do every other year and there are products that we'll do every four or five years, and the industry has demonstrated an appetite for that," he said. "We get a new GTA game every four or five years, but there is an immense appetite. What we're looking at right now is how long is it going to take us to build a truly innovative game in that genre, and when do we think gamers are going to be ready for that next one."

One of the things that makes MMA so exciting is its unpredictability. Unlike boxing, MMA fights can end in an instant if a fighter lands a critical blow. The same is true in UFC 3. Players must consider fighter position, stance, and exposure at all times. A well-timed punch can get you an immediate win. Conversely, missing a crucial strike can leave you open for a finishing blow. These factors were also important in previous UFC games. In UFC 3, their impact has been significantly heightened.
UFC 3 has a massive roster of over 270 fighters. This includes new champions like Demetrius Johnson and legends like BJ Penn. Each fighter’s unique personalities have been captured to make each feel like their real-life counterpart. This not only includes the way fighters strut down to the octagon, but also how they fight. Players can execute the same combos of their favorite champions. This is about as close as you’ll get to being Georges St-Pierre or Connor Macgregor.</P>

UFC 2’s most-played mode was its career mode. Interestingly enough, this was also one of the community’s least favorite options. UFC 3’s G.O.A.T Career Mode takes things to another level by making what you do outside of the ring as important as what you do in it. Players have a set amount of time in-between fights. During that time, they must carefully balance when to train and when they’ll promote themselves and the upcoming bout. This is something real-life UFC fighters must also do. By making time for training and promotion, players will have a better sense of what it’s like to be an MMA fighter.
Like any other real-world champion, you must earn your way to the top. In the World Fighting Alliance, players can knock out opponents to quickly gain the attention of UFC president, Dana White. On the flip side, they can decide to spend time honing their skills before getting a contract. As they progress, players can sign and resign unique contracts to earn more money. They can then use the Fight Cash to promote themselves or for performance-driven objectives.
There are ten different gyms where players can train. Each one offers unique fighting discipline specialties and a roster of real UFC fighters. In gyms, players can learn and master new moves. One has the option of sticking with a specific gym or entering a new gym to learn additional movesets.

Like real UFC fighters, players can create rivalries with other opponents. This helps build fans which in turn can help set or break records. Every UFC fighter has a unique personality, and this is no different for players. They can choose to be calm and cool or a relentless promoter. Players can interact with others and post content that helps increase their reputation worldwide.</p>



<p>There are a nice variety of game modes to indulge in. One of these is UFC 2’s Knockout Mode. Here, players can set the amount of strikes it takes to win. Grapples and ground game are disabled. Stand & Bang is more or less a straight up five-round kickboxing match that only has strikes and no ground game. Submission Shootout is the opposite since players get to show off their ground game skills using holds, ground-and-pound, and submissions to win. Tournament mode is made for groups of friends. Players choose a fighter and see how many foes they can defeat. The last man standing wins. Finally, Fight Now Custom lets players control every setting and slider from transition speed, submission speed, stamina, damage, grapple advantage, health recovery, and perks.</p>
