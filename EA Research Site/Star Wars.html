<tr><td><a href="https://www.ea.com/games/starwars/battlefront/battlefront-2" target="blank"><img src="Graphics\Battlefront2.jpg" height="150"/></a></td><td>Like a Jedi with hatred inside them, Star Wars Battlefront 2 is its own worst enemy. It’s a sequel that’s managed to vastly improve upon its predecessor in some major ways: harder-hitting blasters, a wider variety of iconic Star Wars heroes, gorgeous locations, and a short single-player campaign all stand out. At the same time, it’s taken a giant leap backward with its bafflingly terrible progression system and rushed, disjointed storytelling, which keep it from being much more than shallow Star Wars fun.<br/>(Official Page linked to the left)</td></tr>

<tr><td><a href="http://www.swtor.com/" target="blank"><img src="Graphics\TheOldRepublic.jfif"  /></a></td><td>This story takes place in the Star Wars fictional universe shortly after the establishment of a tenuous peace between the re-emergent Sith Empire and the Galactic Republic. The game features eight different classes. Each of the eight classes has a three act storyline that progresses as the character levels up. Players join either the Republic or the Sith, but players may possess a morality at any point along the light/dark spectrum. Different classes favor different styles of gameplay, and the game features extensive customization options, fully voiced dialogue, companion characters, and dialogue options similar to BioWare's own Mass Effect series.<br/>(Official Page linked to the left)</td></tr>
